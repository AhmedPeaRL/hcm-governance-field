# HCM Governance Field

This field exists to prevent drift.

No decisions are enforced.
No authority is exercised.
No future is planned.

Governance here means:
nothing is allowed to override presence.

This field does not optimize.
It does not respond.
It does not escalate.

It only holds the line.
